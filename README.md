# BudgetTime.io
IST 261 Project

A stand alone application that uses MySql as a database, Java in the middle and JavaFX as the front-end. This application allows you to create an account and set categories in which you are allowed to allot a percentage of your net income to. It then takes that information and creates charts and graphs that shows how much of your money goes into each category.
